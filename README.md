# hello-audio: emit 1KHz square wave on MB2 speaker
Bart Massey 2023

The 1KHz square wave is the "hello world" of audio programs.

While button A on the MB2 is pressed, the program toggles a
GPIO line connected to the MicroBit v2 speaker every 500Âµs:
this causes the MB2 to emit an annoying 1KHz square wave.
